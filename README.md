## Project Description
The attempt of the project was to build an algorithm that is able to recommend books to users based on average ratings of other books in a dataset. The idea behind is to build an engine that gives users the possibilty to tell the mashine a book they like and then get a recommendation of other books that are similar to the one they already read.

## Buisness Use
These algorithms already exist for sure. Everybody knows those personalized recommendations of websites. Those recommendations saying things like: "Customers who bought this Item also bought this...". 

## Dataset
The dataset for this project is provided on Kaggle and consists of 11123 books from 6639 different authors. Additionally, it provides user rating, publisher information, the date of publication as well as the ISBN numbers and the titles.
